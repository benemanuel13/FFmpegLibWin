# FFmpegLibWin

A library to be used with the libAv libraries for Windows - for Linux see sister project.

I have included the appropiate lib and include directories to save you installing ffmpeg.

You do still need to install mingw64 for various libraries and gcc. (if not in C:/msys64/mingw64/ you will need to edit tasks.json to reflect this).
